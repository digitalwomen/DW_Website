					  Python is a general-purpose programming language, created with the design 
					  philosophy of easy readability, and expressing more in less lines of code. 
					  It is widely used in all forms of industry, from creating twitter-bots to 
					  running super computers.
					  <br><br>
					  A notable library of Python is Pygame, which was created to help people
					  develop games or other graphic applications without headaches. It has a
					  strong community, and a selection of many example games for you to check 
					  out.
					  <br><br>
					  <b>How To Get Started</b>
					  You need to first get Python. There are 2 different types of Python,
					  Python 2 and Python 3. We'll suggest that you download and use Python 3.
					  When downloading on Windows, make sure to check the box "Add Python to 
					  PATH". You can then try out Python's tutorial (Link below) to start
					  learning to program Python. We will also have a demo on how to use Python 
					  during the Code Camp at <b>9:30PM</b>

					  If you're interested in creating a hack that has a physical output, you may
					  want to start with Arduino. Arduino is not a programming language, but a
					  microcontroller that is programmed in C/C++. The Arduino is great for 
					  creating hardware hacks that could involve using motors, sensors, lights, 
					  or buttons.
					  <br><br>
					  <b>How To Get Started</b>
					  <br>
					  Major League Hacking (MLH) will be able to supply you with Arduinos for 
					  your project, as well as a few different types of motors, sensors, buttons,
					  and lights. After getting an Arduino board, you can download the Arduino
					  IDE (Link below) to start programming your Arduino. To learn the different
					  things you can do, you can either look at the File > Examples tab to see
					  some working examples, or to check out some of the Arduino tutorials (Link
					  below)

					  Unity is a platform used to create 2D or 3D games or simulations. Unity
					  allows you to create games with ease because it handles most of the 
					  busy work involved with creating the structure of your game, and also 
					  has a helpful, custom IDE (Integrated Development Environment) 
					  specially made to assist you with making your games. You can program 
					  Unity using C# or UnityScript (A derivative of Javascript). You may 
					  want to use Unity if you are interested in making games.
					  <br><br>
					  <b>How To Get Started</b>
					  <br>
					  Go to Unity's store page (Link below), and download the green, personal 
					  version. You can then look at the Unity tutorials (Link below) to start
					  learning. The roll-a-ball tutorial is a good place to start.
					  We will also have a demo on how to use Unity during the CodeCamp at 
					  <b>9:00PM</b>

					  HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the language used to design static web
					  pages. You can view your webpages easily directly from your computer before
					  you host them online. With Git, you can put your website on GitHub, where 
					  they will host it for free! If you ever wanted to make your own website, 
					  this is the place to start.
					  <br><br>
					  <b>How To Get Started</b>
					  <br>
					  You can open up Digital Women's presentation (Link below) for instructions
					  on how to start. After you've completed the short introduction, you can
					  look at the W3Schools extended tutorials (Link below) for more tricks and 
					  tips on how to create the website you want. Finally, when you're ready to 
					  host your website, you can try hosting your website on Github (Link below).

					  Javascript is the programming language used for websites and web

					  Neo4j is a graphic database. This will be useful if you hope to create a 
					  website that needs to store data, such as information about users. It uses a
					  query language called Cypher, which is different from the typical SQL query.
					  language. It can allow you to create relationships between data, and uses a
					  ASCII-Art syntax.
					  <br><br>
					  <b>How To Get Started</b>
					  You can install Neo4J from their website (Link Below). Choose the "For
					  Individuals" version. After installing, you can open up the Neo4J
					  community edition, and you'll see a small screen. There's a box for you
					  to enter in the path of your database, and you can change that to
					  anywhere you want. When you're ready, you can click "Start" to start
					  up the database. You should then see a weblink to Neo4J's API. From
					  there, you can create Neo4J's in-house tutorial. We will also have a

					  NodeJS is used to create servers using Javascript. This is a great

					  Neo4J and HTML to create a full website with a backend.
					  <br><br>
					  <b>How To Get Started</b>
					  You'll need to download the NodeJS library from their website (Link
					  Below). You can then read the below guide on how to start setting up a

					  Git is a type of version control. It's used to keep a log of different 
					  stages of your work, so you can revert back to old code if you don't 
					  like the changes you've made, or it can be used to help work with 
					  others on a project at the same time. There are also websites which 
					  let you store your projects online so you and your teammates can easily
					  access the work and collaborate. Github is one of the more popular 
					  websites for this. 
					  <br><br>
					  <b>How To Get Started</b>
					  <br> You can download Git on their website (Link below). The download
					  may have many options for you to chose from that don't make sense, but
					  won't need to worry about them, the default options are fine. For
					  Windows, Git will install a program called Git Bash, which is where you
					  will do your Git commands. On Macs, you can use Git from the terminal.
					  We will have a demo on how to use Git during the CodeCamp at 
					  <b>8:00PM</b>
